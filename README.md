Hey
I have a new job
I need a bot that says a certain message any given time in a discord server based on a timer
for example every 5 minutes print HI
but the minute variable and the output of what you want to say needs to be customizable
and the discord server you wish to use the bot in

How to use:
- go to discordapp.com/developers/applications, make a new application, make a bot for the application, add bot to desired server, copy the bot token
- open "config.json" and fill in the information
- open "settings.json" and fill in the desired settings
- run "setup.bat", wait for it to automatically close when finished
- run "run.bat" to run the bot
